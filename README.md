# Kin: A Decentralized Ecosystem of Digital Services 

## Overview and Origin

Kin is a cryptocurrency that was launched in May of 2017 by Ted Livingston, the CEO and founder of a popular messaging app known as Kik Interactive. Prior to launching Kin, Ted Livingston decided to do a case study within Kik Interactive in 2015 by launching a program known as Kik Points to its more than 15 million active monthly users. Kik Points gave its users a chance to spend and earn points within the messaging app. Users could spend points by tipping other creators for content or earn points for using apps within the messaging program itself. The results were astounding as millions of users participated in the program giving it an average monthly transaction volume of almost 3x as much as the global transaction volume of Bitcoin. Ted knew he was onto something big and set out to make Kin the most used cryptocurrency in the world by creating a Kin Ecosystem that rewards developers, creators, and users directly. By the end of September 2017, Kin had finished an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and raised $100 million from selling its token.

## Business Activities

The Kin Ecosystem is not your traditional social media business model designed to make money off advertising and selling its user’s data. Instead, it is designed to bring people together in a shared economy that rewards developers, creators, and users for their content. This can be through social media, gaming, chat, or various other apps. App developers are incentivized to create engaging user experiences and are paid directly through the Kin Rewards Engine (treasury that disperses Kin to developers for engaging material based on smart contract technology). Users can spend Kin within the apps on the Kin Ecosystem and earn rewards for doing so. With Kin, consumers earn and spend by being active in the Ecosystem. As more people join, the Ecosystem will inherently grow, which in turn will build the value of the Kin cryptocurrency. As of today, there are more than 60+ apps in use on the Kin Ecosystem with over $70M in rewards already being distributed. Kin was initially created on the Ethereum blockchain, but due to high fees, slow processing speeds and not being able to handle the daily transactional volume, it has since migrated over to the Solana blockchain. The Solana blockchain allows the consumer created apps to transact quickly with very minimal fees.

## Landscape 

Kin is classified under the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain domain, which is being spearheaded by the industry leader, Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin’s creation in 2009, thousands of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols have attempted to make their mark in the sand and become a household name. Some of the other big-name competitors include Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano to name a few. Blockchain technology is a system made to record information in a way that makes it almost impossible to hack, change or cheat. It is a decentralized ledger that exists across a specific network and can be viewed by anyone. Anytime a transaction occurs on a blockchain, it is updated to reflect it on all the participant’s ledgers. The database that is managed by all the participant’s is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The DLT is used because it is programmable, secure, anonymous, immutable, time stamped, and unanimous. In layman’s terms, blockchain technology is used because it can’t be controlled by just one person; rather it is run by all the people who use it. Today, blockchain technology is garnering more and more traction as decentralization and web3 is starting to become more attractive to consumers. Some newer technologies implementing blockchain include the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). 

## Results

Shortly after Kin’s inception, a lawsuit was brought on their parent company, Kik Interactive, from the SEC. The SEC argued that Kik Interactive violated federal securities law by raising money for Kin through an ICO without registering it as a security. Kin’s market capitalization plummeted from all-time highs of over $1 billion to as low as $10 million. After almost 2 years of litigation, and most of Kin’s resources depleted, a settlement was agreed upon. Kik Interactive agreed to pay a $5 million fine to the SEC, and, more importantly, Kin was allowed to continue its operations without having to register itself as a security with the SEC. With the settlement behind them, Kin is focusing on the future and setting the mark high with becoming the most used cryptocurrency in the world. In the month of October 2021, Kin averaged over 370,000 transactions per day ([Kin Newsletter](https://kin.org/kin-newsletter-november-2021/)). Today their market capitalization sits around $140 million.

## Recommendations

Kin is attempting to change the way social media and connecting people within the given communities are ran. They are going up against large conglomerates such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc. To be successful and gain the traction they’d like; I’d suggest them hiring a PR firm to help with their marketing. They started out with a massive user base that was essentially given to them through Kik Interactive, however, they have been attempting to disrupt the landscape for too long to still be valued at such low market capitalization. Kin could use the help from a PR firm to make it more recognizable and mainstream. Additionally, I’d recommend Kin creating their own NFT exchange where users can buy and sell NFT’s with the Kin cryptocurrency. With the popularity of NFT’s continuing to rise, I think it would be a no brainer to offer a way to spend Kin on something that is paving the way of the future. If Kin doesn’t have the resources to create their own NFT exchange, they should consider partnering with an NFT marketplace that will accept their token as a form of payment.
